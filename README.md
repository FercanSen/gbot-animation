Adding Splash Screen Animation to Default Flutter App

## Introduction

This is project created for a [blogpost](https://gbot.dev/2020/03/24/adding-splash-screen-animation-to-default-flutter-app/) on gbot.dev.

I made a splash screen animation with [Rive](https://rive.app/explore/popular/trending/all) (formerly known as Flare) and implemented it to default Flutter app.

## Rive

Rive is a real-time interactive design tool that allows you to design, animate, and immediately integrate your assets into any platform thanks to their open source runtimes.
